## Bookmark2md

This is yet another converter from *NETSCAPE-Bookmark-file-1" DOCTYPE* to:

* Markdown (.md)
* Pretty HTML
* Raw importable HTML *NETSCAPE-Bookmark-file-1" DOCTYPE*


It works by converting all the bookmark hierarchy from the first bookmark subfolder having the given name. See `./resources/usage.txt` for details


### Build

Generate jar (in **/dist** bookmarkFolder)

```	
git clone https://github.com/victormpcmun/bookmark2md	
mvn clean package	
```
